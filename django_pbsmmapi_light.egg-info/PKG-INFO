Description: ========
        PBSMMAPI-LIGHT
        ========
        
        This is a Django app to allow Django-based projects to work with the PBS MediaManager API.
        It is not expected to be a COMPLETE interface to the entirety of the PBS MediaManager; however
        it should allow access to all of the primary content object types.
        
        The "light" version of the app doesn't copy over the content for each record; only enough to identify it in the local database 
        and allow administrative control of which objects are shown on the Django site;  it relies on the API to generate content for each object.
        
        Documentation is in the "docs" directory.
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        1. Add "pbsmmapi" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting:
        
                INSTALLED_APPS = [
                        ...
                        'pbsmmapi-light',
                ]
        
        2. Run  `python manage.py migrate` to create the PBSMM API models.
